# Configuration for Neofetch
# OS_DIR: The sub directory of logos/ (e.g., win, linux, mac)
# TEXT_FILE: The operating system version or distribution to pull.
# I recommend sticking with your version or distro as the text file and your OS as the directory 
# Example:
# Linux Mint: your OS_DIR would be linux and your TEXT_FILE will be mint.txt
# Windows: your OS_DIR would be win and your TEXT_FILE will be 11.txt, xp.txt, me.txt etc.

OS_DIR=win
TEXT_FILE=11.txt
